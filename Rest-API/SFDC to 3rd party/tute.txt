HTTP Classes
-------------


1. These classes expose the HTTP request and response functionality.
	Http Class:  Use this class to initiate an HTTP request and response.
	HttpRequest Class: Use this class to programmatically create HTTP requests like GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE.
	HttpResponse Class: Use this class to handle the HTTP response returned by HTTP.


2. The HttpRequest and HttpResponse classes support these elements.
	A) HttpRequest
		-> HTTP request types, such as GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, CONNECT, HEAD, and OPTIONS
		-> Request headers if needed
		-> Read and connection timeouts
		-> Redirects if needed
		-> Content of the message body
	B) HttpResponse
		-> The HTTP status code
		-> Response headers if needed
		-> Content of the response body



3. Sample code : 
	
public class HttpCalloutSample {

  // Pass in the endpoint to be used using the string url
  public String getCalloutResponseContents(String url) {

    // Instantiate a new Http object
    Http h = new Http();

     // Instantiate a new HTTP request, specify the method (GET) as well as the endpoint
    HttpRequest req = new HttpRequest();
    req.setEndpoint(url);
    req.setMethod('GET');

    // Send the request, and return a response
    HttpResponse res = h.send(req);
    return res.getBody();
  }
}
